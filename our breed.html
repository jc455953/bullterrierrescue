<div class="container ourbreed_text"><h2>THE BULL TERRIER DOG BREED INFORMATION</h2>




<p class="text-justify">Bull terriers were developed in England during the 19th century. Around 1835, a cross between the old English terrier and the bulldog produced the Bull Terrier. Later crosses to the Spanish
Pointer; even later, to the white English terrier and Dalmatian, produced a stylish, tough, white dog. </p>
<p class="text-justify">In the mid 1800s, the white version of the breed, known as "white cavaliers," became a favorite pet among gentry. Crosses to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier reintroduced color around 1900.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Today, Bull Terriers are gentler than their ancestors but are still strong, fearless dogs. They are primarily family pets, but are not suitable for many families.</p>

<div class="container ourbreed_text"><h2>ABOUT OUR BREED</h2> 



<div class="container text-justify"><p><b>Temperament - </b> 	Bull terriers are active, playful clowns. Like a three-year-old child in a dog suit, they like to be DOING something.They need companionship, supervision, and physical activity. They generally love children, and can tolerate roughplay. But they like to play rough, too; and need to be encouraged to be gentle. They can knock little kids down, and it is up to adults to supervise so this can not happen. Bullies love to be the center of attention, and are easily trained if agame appealing to their innate sense of fun can be made of the process. A militaristic approach is apt to leave bothowner and dog unhappy and frustrated; these dogs have a definite what is in it for me attitude, along with theeternal question: Is it fun? If you are seeking a lethargic rug dog you can ignore for days and weeks on end, aBull Terrier is not for you. If it is an active, fun-loving companion and loyal friend you want, a Bully just might be theanswer.

<div class="container text-justify"><p><b>Relationships With Other Animals - </b> If they have been properly socialized as puppies, Bullies may get along with other
dogs in neutral territory, and are not apt to start a fight. However, Bullies can react aggressively to a show of aggression from another dog. 
To owners who do not read canine body language fluently, they can appear trigger happy. Like all terriers, both
 males and females refuse to be pushed around. Bullies may not be inclined to happily accept strange canines in their homes
and yards, caution and control are always required if strangers come to visit. Males and females often get along, as
do females; two males, altered or not, may be inclined to fight. Fights are serious business and must be prevented.
Bull Terriers were initially bred to fight other dogs, and while some show no inclination to do so, others can hardly be
discouraged. Bull Terriers can live happily with cats, if they understand that the cat is part of the household. It is
common for a Bully to learn to love his cat, and yet cheerfully wish to murder all others.
	

<p><b>Neutering -</b> Neutering is advisable for the pet, and is a great kindness. Females are less subject to mammary cancer and uterine
infection.  Pet males never get the chance to have sex, and are frustrated by that compelling itch they can not
scratch. An intact male will be offensive to other animals and their owners, and very likely to his own owner as well.
</p>

<p><b>Physical Aspects	-</b> 	Bull Terriers of both sexes are solid, muscular, and very strong. Weights vary from 27 to 39 kg. They are a lot of dog
crammed into a compact package. Ears are naturally erect (never cropped). The short coat is easy to care for by brisk
brushing to remove the dead hair. Toenails need to be kept short. Vision and sense of smell are keen, and most
Bullies share the terrier lightning fast, trigger sharp reflexes.</p>
<p><b>Physical Problems	-</b> Bull Terriers are vital and healthy, if free from genetic diseases. Genetic deafness occurs now and then, and luxating
patella (slipping kneecaps) is also a genetic problem, causing lameness and pain for the afflicted. Surgery is
sometimes successful. They are prone to heart problems of varying severity, and kidney problems (Polysystic &
Nephritis) . They are subject to skin allergies, both contact, inhalation, and food. These vary widely in severity and
treatability. While they are uncomfortable for the afflicted animal, they are not life-threatening. Old age (double digits)
brings the usual infirmities, to which Bull Terriers are not immune â€“ failing organs and senses, arthritis, and so forth.
 </p>

<p><b>About Rescue Dogs	-</b>Their temperament is Bull Terrier temperament. They are the same cheerful clowns who love activity and to be doing
something,who need to be part of a family. A dog past puppy hood is amenable to training, if you make it fun. Rescue
dogs benefit from training, as this part of their lives has often been neglected.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">Your rescue, being adult, may have had experiences that are not what a loving owner would choose, and his early
socialization may have been neglected. To some extent re-conditioning is possible. These dogs need to be kept safe,
to be prevented from doing harm to others while they are learning that others are no threat. They need to know that
their new owners like other dogs. Sometimes, retraining is not possible, and the new owner has to accept that their
dog just does not like other dogs. Obedience training / socialization can be of great help with a rescue, and such
training is recommended, so long as it is positive in nature. Bullies really do not enjoy the militaristic approach.
.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Great care is suggested in introducing a rescue Bully to cats: these are strong and powerful dogs, fast as lightning.
Inherent in the terrier temperament is a strong prey drive, and if a dog has not been taught to accept and love all
creatures, they may view kitty as lu </p>
<p class="text-justify">Any rescue Bully from our group will be neutered before you get him or her. A large part of the adoption fee you pay
covers that expense. Neutering helps avoid physical problems, and helps avoid behavior problems as well.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> You all know how big your rescue Bully is, because he or she will be an adult, and you all know if she or she is deaf or
not, and if luixating patella is a problem or not. Your rescue will not have died from early renal failure, as more than
likely he or she is too old for that. If he or she has a heart murmur that was discovered at the time of neutering, that
will be disclosed.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">If you adopt a dog from our group, you can always contact us for any help. We will try and will provide you with
knowledgeable advice on a wide range of subjects. We care about the dogs, and we care about you, too. We want
you to be happy with your new best friend.</p>
